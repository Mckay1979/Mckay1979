Hi there! ğŸ‘‹
I'm @Mckay1979, and I'm passionate about home management and AI development. Currently diving deep into Python, I'm working on an exciting project that combines AI for home/family management. My focus right now is on facial recognition, screen recording, and teaching the AI to understand what's happening on the screen.

ğŸŒ± I'm learning Python and AI development.
ğŸ’¡ I'm exploring the intersection of home management and cutting-edge technology.
ğŸ‘€ I'm open to collaboration and mentorship opportunities.
ğŸ“« Reach out to me at firstshays@gmail.com.

Let's build something amazing together! ğŸ˜„
